# Pong

## Pong in C
Done, works, cool

## Pong in GAS ASM
Have an actual working pong game made in ASM now

run make in asm-pong folder
The command `xhost +` is required to be run so that the assembly program can interface with the X11 local server without authentication (i couldnt figure out the auth code)
